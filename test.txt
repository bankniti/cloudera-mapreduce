Tron is an decompressor for files packed with compressors like
PKLITE or DIET. In case you don't know, such programs use different
data compression routines to make a file smaller. Files which
were compressed with one of these pack programs will still stay
executable for the system but they will be much smaller. Another
reason for compressing is that a second person has no chance
to change any bytes inside a compressed program with a hex editor
or something like that. But this feature has disadvantages, too.
For example a virus scanner is not abble to detect a virus under
the compression structure. And on some systems a decompression routine
wastes a lot of time (8086 or lower, hehe).

The first is the primary reason why we decided to write Tron.
Tron itself is able to decompress most common packers as there are
PKLITE, DIET, LZEXE, TINY, EXEPACK, PRO-PACK, COMPACK etc..

Some of these compression programs have a build in EXPAND function!
But for insiders it is no problem to trick this functions out!
"Simply change the Header Signature "MZ" into "ZM" and the original
programs cannot handle their own files any longer. The header signature
can be found at the start of an EXE file!
And this is only one of many known possibilities.

To unpack TinyProg packed files you must register first.
(READ REGISTER.TXT)
Before running tronreg.exe make sure that the tron.exe file
is not packed. After registering tron can be packed again.
